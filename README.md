## Contributing to swift for the web

I've built [coenttb.com](https://coenttb.com) entirely in Swift and [open-sourced](https://github.com/coenttb/coenttb-com-server) it. It uses the following packages, built for the Swift on web ecosystem:

- [swift-css](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-css) - A type-safe CSS DSL
- [swift-html](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-html) - HTML DSL with swift-css integration
- [swift-web](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-web) - Modern fork of PointFree's web architecture
- [coenttb-web](https://github.com/coenttb/coenttb-web) - Extended web framework with Vapor integrations
- [swift-languages](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-languages) - Cross-platform translation library

## Current focus

- Advising groundbreaking life sciences projects:
  - [100+ study](https://100plus.nl) at Amsterdam UMC
  - [Alzheimer Genetics Hub](https://alzheimergenetics.org)
  - [DEMENTREE biobank](https://www.alzheimercentrum.nl/wetenschap/lopend-onderzoek/biobank-dementree/)
- Contributing to the Swift web development ecosystem
- Building legal tech (in _stealth_)
- Writing about the intersection of law, technology, and startup life

## The journey

Started as a law student with big dreams in legal tech, survived two near-bankruptcies, and emerged with a unique perspective on building software. Now I'm combining my legal expertise with a passion for elegant code, proving that Swift can be a powerful tool for web development and legal tech.

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- Writing clean, functional code that stands the test of time
- Learning in public and helping others avoid common pitfalls
- Building tools that bridge the gap between law and technology
- Making web development in Swift not just possible, but elegant
