# Coen ten Thije Boonkkamp

**Lawyer ‚Ä¢ Swift Developer ‚Ä¢ Founder**

I see a future where no person again faces the unjust reality that economic differences significantly dictate legal outcomes. To reach that future, we need technology that makes legal services accessible and affordable.  

Another reality is that the infrastructure to reach this, just isn't there yet.

That's why I build type-safe Swift web infrastructure‚Äîfrom PostgreSQL queries to HTML rendering, from payments infrastructure to email. 90+ open source packages working together in production. Pioneering server-side Swift through real-world systems that prove the language's potential beyond iOS.

And I plan to take all my learnings back to legal. But first:

## My contributions to the Swift open source ecosystem

## üéØ Philosophy

I build tools that make wrong things impossible. Every abstraction removes entire classes of errors. My frameworks don't just work - they teach you how to build better systems.

**Core beliefs:**
- Type safety is a feature, not overhead
- Swift's future extends far beyond Apple platforms
- The best code is code that guides its users
- Building in public accelerates everyone's learning
